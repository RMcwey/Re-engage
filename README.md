## Description

- **Why did you build this project?** We wanted an app that could help ourselves and others with studies, scripture memory or even preparing for speeches.
- **What problem does it solve?** This app helps alleviate some of the stress when trying to focus when studying, preparing for speeches, and  memorizing text like the Bible.
- **What did you learn?** We learned a lot about react, API calls, MongoDb, typeDefs, resolvers and nextUI.
