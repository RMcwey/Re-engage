## Description 

- **What was your motivation?** To work together as a team and build an app that would help a user engage more with whatever text they would like.
- **Why did you build this project?** We wanted an app that could help ourselves and others with studies, scripture memory or even preparing for speeches.
- **What problem does it solve?** This app helps alleviate some of the stress when trying to focus when studying, preparing for speeches, and  memorizing text like the Bible.
- **What did you learn?** We learned a lot about react, API calls, MongoDb, typeDefs, resolvers and nextUI.
